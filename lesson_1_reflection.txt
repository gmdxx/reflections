How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because I will be centered in my new changes and I won`t spend time finding them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can spend less time reviewing how a file has changed through the time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: I select the best moment to save a funcionally version of my code
	cons: I could lost my made changes if my computer crashs

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is because Git is oriented to file code that are functionally linked them in each version.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use that commands when i want to check the work that I or others have done in the code repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Thanks to log history I can revert my code to one stable version if my new changes donÂ´t work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to edit and create code and have a best control of that.
